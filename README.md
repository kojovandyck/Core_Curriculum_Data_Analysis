# Core_Curriculum_Data_Analysis
 This project was to assist the New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) Core Curriculum coordinators and students to visualize core curriculum data and statistics via a web app. This was done using Streamlit to create the data web app. Currently, it allows the user to select which semester, department, and Core category which provides them with information on courses offered under those specifications. I did most of the data analysis via Excel automation tools but felt the need to create a more user friendly interface where users could quickly look up data in a convenient way without having to check our annual bulletin or look at some google sheets.
